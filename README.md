# SMILEI_QT_GUI V0.11
Graphical User Interface for Smilei PIC code analysis.


### Multiples diagnostic tabs
- Fields diagnostic tab: Ex, Ey, Ez, Bx, By, Bz, Er, Etheta, Br, Btheta
- TrackParticles diagnostic tab: AM radial and transverse distribution
- Plasma diagnostic tab: Bz and ne longitudinal and transverse distribution
- Tornado SSH & SCP pooling: list of running and finished simulations with progress bar and estimated completion time. Download all simulations data directly from the app

### Comparison between simulations

Can compare Scalar and Plasma diagnostics between 2 simulations

### Efficient memory management

Only the plotted data are stored in memory, making possible to open multiple diagnostic simultaneously. 

### IPython & Log & Memory graph dialog

Allows to access app variables and perform operation or print them to the log dialog. Memory dialog allows fast and accurate memory management for large simulation diagnostics
